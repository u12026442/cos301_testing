\subsection{CreateBuzzSpace}
The priority of creating a Buzz Space is a critical use case. Without it, lecturers may not create a Buzz space for a particular module they present during a particular year. It should create a root thread for the buzz space with an associated welcome post and assign the lecturer as administrator to that particular space.

\subsubsection{Spaces A}
\textbf{Service Construct:}  To Identify the user \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition 1:}  Module is active for current year.  \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition 2:}  Upon cration, no buzz space should exist \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition 3:}  User must be a lecture for the spesific module \newline
\textbf{Result:} Success on the first two  pre-conditions. Failure on the last pre-condition.Exceptions are thrown if pre-condition is not met.\newline

\textbf{Post-condition:} Buzz Space Created on success of pre-conditions. \newline
\textbf{Result:} Success, although any authenticated user may create a Buzz Space.\newline
  
\textbf{Discussion:}Users are not identified by their unique roles upon Buzz creation. Any user may create a Buzz Space as long as it doesn't exist.Upon a created Buzz space, threads may be created, active modules are retieved as well as user roles for modules. 

\subsubsection{Spaces B}
\textbf{Service Construct:} To Identify the user \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition 1:}  Module is active for current year.  \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition 2:}  Upon cration, no buzz space should exist \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition 3:}  User must be a lecture for the spesific module \newline
\textbf{Result:} Success on the first two  pre-conditions. Failure on the last pre-condition.Exceptions are thrown if pre-condition is not met. \newline

\textbf{Post-condition:} Buzz Space Created. \newline
\textbf{Result:} Success. \newline
  
\textbf{Discussion:} A registered user can create a Buzz Space successfuley. Though after creation it lacks in most of the functionality, nameley thread creation, registering on the buzz space, getting active modules for the year, getting user roles for modules and assigning an administrative user.
