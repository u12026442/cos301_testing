\subsection{Conclusion for sapaces B}
In conclusion, the spaces module that team B submitted was also not a resounding success. Again some of the functionality that they implemented can be used, but the module as a whole is not ready for deployment. All though the team did follow a lot of the standards that where requested of them meaning that the module can simply be plugged into the rest of the Buzz system, there was very little provided by the team to help with future maintenance of the system. Some of the functionality was successful, however it to was incomplete. Taking the same example, when Creating Buzz Space the Buzz Space is created, however there is little to no security that should monitor who can and cannot create the space, there is no trace of this action being kept, either in a log file or in the audit database and therefor no accountability. We see the same situation arise in the getProfileForUser. However, when it comes to closing a Buzz Space the functional contract was fully adhered to because everything that is required of the function is performed. However, the same issues with the auditability, security and maintainability we present.
