\subsection{Conclusion for sapaces A}
In conclusion, the spaces module that team A submitted was not a resounding success. Some of the functionality that they implemented can be used, but the module as a whole is not ready for deployment. The team didnâ€™t follow the standards that where requested of them meaning that the module cannot simply be plugged into the rest of the Buzz system. Some of the functionality was successful, however incomplete. For example, when Creating Buzz Space the Buzz Space is created, however there is little to no security that should monitor who can and cannot create the space, there is no trace of this action being kept, either in a log file or in the audit database and therefor no accountability. We see the same situation arise in the getProfileForUser and when closing a Buzz Space.
