\subsection{getProfileForUser}

getProfileForUser is a critical use case in the Spaces module as it used to return the profile a user has on the Buzz Space.
The implementation of this use case is inclusive of a query service which returns the relevant profile.
Before the query is made there is a requirement that a Buzz Space exists and that a user is associated with a Buzz Space.
Thereafter the result from the query is returned with no other modifications to the Buzz Space.
Detailed below is an evaluation of Buzz Space A and Buzz Space B to determine whether or not they conform to the pre and post conditions required by the getProfileForUser service contract. 

\subsubsection{Spaces A}
\textbf{Pre-condition:}  BuzzSpace is active \newline
\textbf{Result:}  Failure \newline
\textbf{Discussion:}  There is no apparent evidence present in the getProfileForUser use case that indicates that a Buzz Space is tested for activness/inactivess.
The use case is conducted under the assumption that the Buzz Space is active, this is in violation of the service contract pre-condition. \newline \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition:}  User is associated to the relevant Buzz Space\newline
\textbf{Result:}  Success \newline
\textbf{Discussion:}  The getProfileForUser use case conducts the query service by ensuring that the current user being searched is associated with the respective Buzz Space.
\subsubsection{Spaces B}
\textbf{Pre-condition:}  Buzz Space is active \newline
\textbf{Result:}  Failure \newline
\textbf{Discussion:}  There is no apparent evidence present in the getProfileForUser use case that indicates that a Buzz Space is tested for activness/inactivess.
The use case is conducted under the assumption that the Buzz Space is active, this is in violation of the service contract pre-condition. \newline \newline
\textbf{Pre-condition:}  User is associated to the relevant Buzz Space\newline
\textbf{Result:}  Success \newline
\textbf{Discussion:}  The getProfileForUser use case conducts the query service by ensuring that the current user being searched is associated with the respective Buzz Space.
